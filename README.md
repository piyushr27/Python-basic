1) Number guessing game
  Built a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range. <br>
  Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to integer. <br>
  Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses

2) Word guessing game
   In this game, there is a list of words present, out of which our interpreter will choose 1 random word. <br>
   The user first has to input their names and then, will be asked to guess any alphabet.<br>
   If the random word contains that alphabet, it will be shown as the output(with correct placement) else the program will ask you to guess another alphabet.<br>
   The user will be given 12 turns(which can be changed accordingly) to guess the complete word.
